\begin{frame}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Gradients for FD and Adjoint do not depend on $\epsilon$. $\epsilon=0.001$, same results for $\epsilon=0.01,0.0001$.
        \item FD and Adjoint different results, but at least the sign is the same
        \item The adjoint results are sensible to the boundary condition on the airfoil surface. Fixing $\Psi_u = [-1.0, 0.0]$ or $\Psi_u = [-C_D, 0.0]$ impact the gradients.
        \item Error in boundary conditions? The error should be eliminated due to the difference $I'-I$.
